This will help to overcome the tedious manual work by replacing it with digital technology of smart cards. Attendance is very useful in colleges and schools to keep a track of punctuality of students as well as preparation of list of blacklist according to the guidelines of University. Currently the attendance of students, entering the data into system other calculations is done manually by the staff. All this work can be done automatically using smart cards with the help of various technologies like RFID, barcode technology, QR code. Smart cards here can be used in canteens too, students can get their smart cards recharged from the canteen and office previously and then later canteen bills can be paid directly using smart card number without having the need to carry cash. Also payments can be made in office related works too using smart cards such as exam fees, form fees, any kind of fine etc. It is developed to ease the work of student's, involves a card containing a barcode which is nothing but a unique card that is given to each student. The smart card can be used at many places like office, library and canteen. The amount (balance) in the card can always be refilled with the help of admin. The unique id is stored in the barcode ,when the barcode is scanned the balance is deducted from the students account that is associated with the unique id. The unique id is scanned with the help of barcode scanner .It can also be used to store important documents. This is done by scanning the unique id stored in the card which in turn is been sent to the server where the student's documents stored .Thus the user doesn't have to carry its documents always with him. The student can use this card in office to pay fine and the amount will be calculated depending on the information stored in database which is retrieved by scanning the unique id on the card. It can also be used in stationary shop and canteen. Thus this makes very easy for a student he just needs to carry a portable card which will be very secure.
